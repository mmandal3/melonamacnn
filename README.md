## General Information
- In medical fields use of Machine Learning technologies have been leveraged for decision making, identification of diseases etc.
- The current assignment is to predict type of skin cancer from images. 
- The dataset contain images of various types of skin cancers. There are around 2400 such images in total for training. Training Data is split into train and validation (80:20).


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- A CNN based neural network has been built using ~2400 training. Model accuracy is not good and overfitting also.
- Augmented data shows good accuracy but overfitting still existing.
